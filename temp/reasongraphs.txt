To me it is still the case that trust is partially supported by proof 
just like TimBL was drawing it a generation ago.

Proofs are fully supported by logic and we revamp that idea in
https://github.com/eyereasoner/reasongraphs/blob/main/README.md 

So the idea is to have a standard syntax (RDF 1.1 TriG) and a specified
semantics (N3 spec).

The tests in https://github.com/eyereasoner/reasongraphs/tree/main

In the Semantic Web Layer Cake, logic enables machines to apply formal 
reasoning rules to data, allowing them to draw inferences and generate 
structured proofsâ€”logical sequences that connect data points to valid 
conclusions. These proofs demonstrate how conclusions are derived, 
making the reasoning process transparent. This transparency is crucial 
for establishing trust because it allows users (or systems) to verify 
the path from data to conclusion, ensuring that information is not only 
consistent but also traceable. Thus, logic underpins proof, and proof, 
in turn, establishes the foundation for trust, which is essential for a 
reliable, verifiable web.
