The idea of [RDF Lingua](https://github.com/eyereasoner/see/tree/main/lingua#readme)
is as simple as reasoning with rules described in RDF and able to give answers
and proof explanations in RDF.

See some [examples](https://github.com/eyereasoner/see/tree/main/lingua)
covering the whole reasoning spectrum from the classical
[socrates](https://github.com/eyereasoner/see/blob/main/lingua/socrates.trig)
to the modern
[restdesc](https://github.com/eyereasoner/see/blob/main/lingua/restdesc.trig)
and
[gps](https://github.com/eyereasoner/see/blob/main/lingua/gps.trig).

The dialog language is a not bottom up approach nor a top down approach
but rather a middle out approach meaning to make real world problems
tangible. Tangible in the sense to take them and talk/dialog about them
in a universal lingua franca.

So we separate talking/dialoging, reasoning and doing and what we
mainly miss is a universal dialog language.

N3 was invented in 2000 by TimBL as a research language but since many
years he is not actively developing it anymore. The N3 CG kind of took
over but all I can say is that I, as an implementor or the EYE reasoner
am not feeling that we reached consensus.
Today we work on RDF Lingua as a pure RDF 1.X which could rountrip to N3
and we believe that it can work for everything we have done so far in N3.
