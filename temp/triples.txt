To serve a more abstract layer of wiring, just like
- the nuts and bolts do for mechanics
- the copper wires do for electronics
- the silicon gates do for digital hardware
- the program lines do for software
so do the triples for symbolic ai and algorithms

It does not pay off immediately, costs a lot of misery
but is the future (just like you raise children).

The point is not to be better but to have inherent potential.
