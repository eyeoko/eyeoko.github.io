It is not really top-down nor bottom-up nor end-to-end, but rather the 
middle-out approach of the late Hans Cools that could help us to reach
our goal.

You start somewhere in the middle and then go around, from more detail 
to more abstract and so on until "it feels good in your hands".

That is also the core of the origin-evolution-observership triptych of 
the late Stephen Hawking explained by Thomas Hertog in the best book I
ever read, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Time.
