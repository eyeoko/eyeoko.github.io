is a benchmark combining the extended deep taxonomy, a new scientist 
puzzle and a 5 fold meta-interpretation.

It requires 214246 inferences.

The Tau Prolog javascript backward chainer takes 95 sec reasoning time 
so it runs at 2265 lips (logical inferences per second).

The swipljs (used by eyebrow) takes 0.082 sec reasoning time so it runs 
at 2612146 lips which is 1150 times faster! 

Rust based Scryer Prolog takes 0.097 sec reasoning time which is 2208598 lips
and its rebis-dev branch takes 0.048 sec reasoning time which is 4463458 lips.

The C based swipl takes 0.023 sec reasoning time which is 9260901 lips.
