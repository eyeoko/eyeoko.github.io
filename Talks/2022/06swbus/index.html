<h1>Use case GPS4IntegratedCare</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en/what-we-offer/research-portfolio/gps4integratedcare">GPS4IntegratedCare</a> project
was fully built on top of we call <a href="https://github.com/josd/eye/tree/master/reasoning/gps">GPS</a>

Goal driven Parallel Sequences
------------------------------

Inspired by https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15816-s12/lectures/01-inference.pdf

[[
In linear logic we are instead concerned with the change of truth with a
change of state. We model this in a very simple way: when an inference rule
is applied we consume the propositions used as premises and produce the
propositions in the conclusions, thereby effecting an overall change in state.

<h1>Use case GPS4IntegratedCare findings</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The project worked out fine, but the architecture is centralized around a single smart workflow engine and that is really not scalable.</p>
<p>The proposal is to address that scalability with <a href="https://github.com/josd/eye/tree/master/reasoning/map">MAP</a>
<pre>
------------------
Multi-Agent Proofs
------------------

Multiple agents can work together by using their own knowledge/logic/data
and proofs made by other agents.

The proofs are guaranteeing a transparent and accountable way of working
and they only disclose what is relevant, so there is no need to have an
"All knowledge is contained in here" (what I learned from Tim Berners-Lee).
</pre>
</p>
<p>This is just a proposal with a <a href="https://github.com/josd/eye/tree/master/reasoning/map">proof of concept</a>
in which agent1 and agent2 are GPS agents and agent2 reaches his goal thanks to the lemmata made by agent1.
