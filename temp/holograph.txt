Horn logic graphs

RDF Lingua [1] graphs with embedded Horn logic [2].

Why we have those "holographs" is simply to be explicit about an
RDF Lingua graph with embedded Horn Logic as a formalization of a
/conceptualization/ inspired by what Pat Hayes said [3]:

[[
And there is a good reason why this happens. Yes, we are all talking
about the same one world. And let us assume, for the purposes of
argument, that we are all using the same formalism. (Of course not
true, but translating between formalisms is relatively straighforward.)
Still, we will not all create the same ontology, or even compatible
ontologies. (I called this the "diamond of confusion" in a talk about
20 years ago.) And this is because an ontology is, in Tom Gruber's
phrase, a formalization of a /conceptualization/, not a formalization
of /reality/. And while there is widespread agreement on the nature of
the actual world, there is most emphatically not universal agreement on
conceptualizations of it. People are still arguing about ontological
conceptualizations that were discussed by the Greek philosphers 2000
years ago.
