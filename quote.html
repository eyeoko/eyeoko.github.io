<h1>Quotes</h1>

<pre>
Any technology that scales ought to have
some reasonable amount of redundancy.

Reasoning is like a welding machine
transforming data into proofs.

Mathematics is at the heart of everything
I do and has never failed me.

There is no principle to tell whether to
use top-down or bottom-up reasoning.

A reasoner that can not give a proof
is not a reasoner.
