<h1>Use case GPS4IntegratedCare</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.imec-int.com/en/what-we-offer/research-portfolio/gps4integratedcare">GPS4IntegratedCare project</a>
   objective is <b>Automatic generation of dynamic and personalized care workflows</b>
</p>
<p>Technologies used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Semantic Web Language (JSON-LD, Turtle, N3)</li>
  <li>Reasoning Engine (EYE)</li>
</ul>
<p>Goal driven Parallel Sequences (GPS):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Inspired by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fp/courses/15816-s12/lectures/01-inference.pdf">Linear Logic</a></li>
  <li>"In linear logic we are instead concerned with the change of truth with a
      change of state. We model this in a very simple way: when an inference rule
      is applied we consume the propositions used as premises and produce the
      propositions in the conclusions, thereby effecting an overall change in state."</li>
  <li>Implemented in <a href="https://github.com/josd/eye/blob/master/reasoning/gps/gps-plugin.n3">GPS plugin for EYE</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Use case GPS4IntegratedCare lessons learned</h1>
<p>The project worked out fine, but the architecture is centralized around a single smart workflow engine and that is really not scalable.</p>
<p>The proposal is to address the scalability with <a href="https://github.com/josd/eye/tree/master/reasoning/map">MAP</a></p>
<p>Multi-Agent Proofs (MAP):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple agents can work together by using their own knowledge/logic/data and proofs made by other agents.</li>
  <li>The proofs are guaranteeing a transparent and accountable way of working
      and they only disclose what is relevant, so there is no need to have an
      "All knowledge is contained in here" (what I learned from Tim Berners-Lee).</li>
      
</ul>
<p>This is just a proposal with a <a href="https://github.com/josd/eye/tree/master/reasoning/map">proof of concept</a>
in which agent1 and agent2 are GPS agents and agent2 reaches his goal thanks to the lemmata made by agent1.</p>

<h1>Multi-Agent Proofs: Agent2 reaches his goal thanks to the lemmata made by Agent1</h1>

<h1>Reverse the burden of proof</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The burden of proof is now on the server: the server has to find out why he should do the job for the client</li>
  <li>There is no omniscient server</li>
  <li>Reverse the burden of proof: the client provides a proof, the server checks that proof and if fine does the job for the client</li>
  <li>Is much more scalable but requires client side reasoning and proof generation</li>
  <li>The proof could be provided as HTTP GET payload</li>
