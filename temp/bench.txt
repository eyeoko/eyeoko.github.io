is a benchmark combining the extended deep taxonomy, a new scientist 
puzzle and a 5 fold meta-interpretation.

It requires 214246 inferences.

The Tau Prolog javascript backward chainer takes 95 sec reasoning time 
so it runs at 2265 lips (logical inferences per second).

The swipljs (used by eyejs) takes 0.082 sec reasoning time so it runs 
at 2612146 lips which is 1150 times faster! 

The Rust based Scryer takes 0.097 sec reasoning time which is 2208598 lips.

The C based swipl takes 0.023 sec reasoning time which is 9260901 lips.
