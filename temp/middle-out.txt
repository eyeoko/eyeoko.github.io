It is not really top-down nor bottom-up nor end-to-end, but rather the 
middle-out approach of the late Hans Cools.

You start somewhere in the middle and then go around, from more detail 
to more abstract and so on until "it feels good in your hands".

That is also the core of the origin-evolution-observership approach of 
the late Stephen Hawking.
