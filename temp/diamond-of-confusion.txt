And there is a good reason why this happens. Yes, we are all talking 
about the same one world. And let us assume, for the purposes of 
argument, that we are all using the same formalism. (Of course not 
true, but translating between formalisms is relatively straighforward.) 
Still, we will not all create the same ontology, or even compatible 
ontologies. (I called this the "diamond of confusion" in a talk about 
20 years ago.) And this is because an ontology is, in Tom Gruber's 
phrase, a formalization of a /conceptualization/, not a formalization 
of /reality/. And while there is widespread agreement on the nature of 
the actual world, there is most emphatically not universal agreement on 
conceptualizations of it. People are still arguing about ontological 
conceptualizations that were discussed by the Greek philosphers 2000 
years ago.
