<h1>Quotes</h1>

<pre>
Silicon seems to scale like n square -
the Web seems to scale like n cube.

Any technology that scales ought to have
some reasonable amount of redundancy.

Reasoning is like a welding machine
transforming data into proofs.

Mathematics is at the heart of everything
I do and has never failed me.
