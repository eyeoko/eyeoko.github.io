For EYE we strive to realize the inherent potential of mathematical reasoning:

- direct proof: a logical method starting from the statement to be proven
  (top-down) and known facts or axioms (bottom-up), working step-by-step
  from both directions until they meet to form a complete logical argument.

- proof by contrapositive: a logical method where you prove that if the
  conclusion is false, the premise must also be false, which is logically
  equivalent to proving the original statement.

- proof by contradiction: a logical method where you assume the negation of
  the statement to be proven, derive a contradiction, and conclude that the
  original statement must be true.

- proof by cases: a logical method where a statement is proven by dividing
  it into distinct, exhaustive cases and demonstrating that the statement
  holds true in each case.

- proof by recursion: a logical method of establishing a result by defining
  a base case and a recursive step that derives the solution for larger
  cases from smaller ones.
