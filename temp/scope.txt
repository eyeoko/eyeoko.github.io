Talking about Plato, more specifically the Socratic dialogs, it reminds 
me that we can tackle the complexity of a client asking a question to a 
decentralized knowledge graph by simply carrying on a dialog like "I 
don't know, but he knows" so the client interface can ask him. It is 
also called Socratic completeness and I believe it is scalable because 
the dialogue is typically limited in space and time.

One small stepping stone might be the use of reasoning to derive the
right questions.
