Horn logic graphs - holographs
------------------------------

Holographs are RDF graphs with embedded Horn logic [1].

Holographs support reasoning with forward rules described in RDF as

    _:bng_1 log:implies _:bng_2.

    _:bng_1 {
        RDF triples
    }

    _:bng_2 {
        RDF triples
    }

A forward rule with log:implies false is an inference fuse.


Holographs also support reasoning with backward rules described in RDF as

    _:bng_1 log:isImpliedBy _:bng_2.

    _:bng_1 {
        RDF triples
    }

    _:bng_2 {
        RDF triples
    }


Holographs also support querying with queries described in RDF as

    _:bng_1 log:query _:bng_2.

    _:bng_1 {
        RDF triples
    }

    _:bng_2 {
        RDF triples
    }


The var: prefix is <http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/var#> and is used for
variables that are interpreted as universally quantified variables except for
forward rule conclusion-only variables which are interpreted as existentially
quantified variables.

Literal subjects are described as

    [] rdf:value "aha"; :p :o.


Why we have those "holographs" is simply to be explicit about an
RDF graph with embedded Horn logic as a formalization of a
/conceptualization/ inspired by what Pat Hayes said [2]:

[[
And there is a good reason why this happens. Yes, we are all talking
about the same one world. And let us assume, for the purposes of
argument, that we are all using the same formalism. (Of course not
true, but translating between formalisms is relatively straighforward.)
Still, we will not all create the same ontology, or even compatible
ontologies. (I called this the "diamond of confusion" in a talk about
20 years ago.) And this is because an ontology is, in Tom Gruber's
phrase, a formalization of a /conceptualization/, not a formalization
of /reality/. And while there is widespread agreement on the nature of
the actual world, there is most emphatically not universal agreement on
conceptualizations of it. People are still arguing about ontological
conceptualizations that were discussed by the Greek philosphers 2000
years ago.
