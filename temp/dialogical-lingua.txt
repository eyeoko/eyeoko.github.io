Literally speaking it is a language that is used for dialogs on the 
web. More specifically it is meant to achieve socratic completeness. 
The socratic completeness idea guarantees that for any fact which is a 
logical consequence of the assumed theories, there is a series of 
preliminary queries and assumptions after which a query of the fact 
will succeed.

We can tackle the complexity of a client asking a question to a 
decentralized knowledge graph by simply carrying on a dialog like "I 
don't know, but he knows" so the client interface can ask him. I 
believe it is scalable because the dialog is typically limited in space 
and time. One small stepping stone might be the use of reasoning to 
derive the right questions.
